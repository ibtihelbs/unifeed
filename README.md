This challenge is built on top of [Codewell - Unifeed page blog](https://www.codewell.cc/challenges/unifeed-blog-page--608d9d5c747bad001532bd7c).
The goal of this challenge is to breakdown and simplify the steps of creating an **(HTML and CSS)** project and to share code on **Github** while keeping on track all the changes of that project.

# Rules


>**1:** You will spend at least 15 minutes each day for the next six days working on a task assigned to you.\
>**2:** When the 15 minutes are up, you have the choice to continue or to stop.\
>**3:**Â  **Remember that**Â  you are not permitted to complete the previous day's task on any given day.\
>**4:** You should commit your new changes daily.\
>**5:** If you decide to make changes to the task assigned for the day, you should commit them and give them the "commit name -- edited" attribute.\


### I've completed the challenge, now what?

We recommend using one of these two websites to deploy your projects
